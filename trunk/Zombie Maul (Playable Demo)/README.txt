Short Introduction:  Our hero is out to start his own zombie apocalypse and what better place to do so but at his local mall.

Brief Play Description: 
You are constantly hungry for live human organs, primarily the brain if the donor has one. You are always moving forward, but you can control his direction with the 'a' or left arrow and the 'd' or right arrow. Try and satisfy your hunger and create your zombie horde. Watch out for the mall police, they don't take kindly to zombies starting the apocalypse. Also, don't run into your own, because their organs aren't the freshest to feast on. Try to infect as many humans as possible before your time runs out.

Movement:
'a' or left arrow
'd' or right arrow

Objective:
Run into living humans to feast on them and make them part of your ranks to gain points. Avoid Mall cops and other zombies as that will run down your time faster.

===========================
****  BUG LIST  ***********
===========================

--Spawning off map - 

When starting the game, the Hero will spawn off map.  This event seemed random.  Quit game and restart to load correctly.



--Footsteps after end game -

Footsteps audio still audible after game end.

To replicate:

Begin game and play until timer runs out.
Score screen will still have the sound of the player walking.



--New game continues previous game:

Starting a new game right after you have finished will cause the old game to continue while a new game starts.  Both will be "overlayed" in a sense on the playable area.  We witnessed two Hero's during this gameplay state which leads me to believe two games are currently going on.
